# Bela
Bela blok
This is a mobile application I made to be used while playing Belot/Bela, a card game popular in Croatia (where I live) and other countries in 
that region. It is used to keep track of current point distribution and to which team the points go to. It can be downloaded from Google 
Play (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.companyname.bela). Since I made the program in Xamarin Forms, it is already made for IOS 
too, but unfortunately I don't have an Iphone or a Macbook so I cant upload it to Apple's app store.
